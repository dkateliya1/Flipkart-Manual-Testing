# Flipkart-Manual-Testing
Manual testing project for the Flipkart e-commerce web application covering 16 functional modules. Designed and executed 290+ test cases (18+ per module), including positive, negative, and boundary scenarios. Maintained RTM and Bug/Enhancement sheets to ensure full test coverage and defect traceability.


# Brief description 
This repository showcases a comprehensive Manual Testing project performed on the Flipkart e-commerce web application, focusing on validating core business workflows, usability, and system reliability from an end-user perspective.

The project covers end-to-end functional testing of critical modules including User Registration & Login, Product Search, Filters & Sorting, Product Details Page, Cart Management, Checkout, Payments, Orders, and Profile Management. Test cases were designed based on detailed requirement analysis, ensuring complete coverage of positive, negative, and boundary scenarios.

A structured Test Plan and Test Strategy were created to define scope, approach, environments, and entry/exit criteria. Test cases were mapped to requirements using a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) to ensure no functionality was left untested. Special focus was given to UI/UX validation, cross-browser compatibility, network handling, and error message verification.

The project also includes bug reports documented with clear reproduction steps, severity, priority, expected vs actual results, and screenshots (where applicable). Bugs were categorized effectively to help stakeholders understand impact and resolution urgency. A separate Bug/Enhancement Sheet was maintained to track out-of-scope and web-specific limitations.

Overall, this project demonstrates strong hands-on experience in manual testing methodologies, test documentation, defect life cycle understanding, and real-world e-commerce domain knowledge
